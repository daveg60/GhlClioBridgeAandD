Agent: Hi, thank you for calling Albertson & Davidson, Trust Trial Lawyers. Are you a current client of the firm?

User: No.

Agent: Alright, are you looking to become a new client, or is there another reason for your call?

User: I'm looking to become a new client.

Agent: Got it. Can you please describe the legal matter you're dealing with?

User: Yes. I have a trust litigation issue in California.

Agent: Alright, so this is a trust litigation matter in California. Let me confirm—does this involve real property, or is the trustee or the trust located in California?

User: Yes.

Agent: Okay, thank you. Is this related to a potential or currently contested trust, or is it for trust litigation?

User: I said it was for trust litigation. Where are you getting lost on this?

Agent: Got it, trust litigation—thanks for clarifying. We’ll go through a few questions to determine if we can assist. It should only take a few minutes. Are you okay with that?

User: No. I'm short on time.

Agent: Understood. Let’s go with a shorter version of the questions. First, is this for a trust or a will?

User: It's for a trust. I already said that.

Agent: Thanks for confirming. Do you know the date of inception of the trust?

User: No.

Agent: Alright, were there any amendments to the trust that you’re aware of?

User: No.

Agent: Okay. Do you have a copy of the trust, or can you get one?

User: Yeah.

Agent: Great. How many beneficiaries are there in the trust?

User: One.

Agent: Thanks. Are you the beneficiary, or are you speaking on behalf of the beneficiary?

User: Yeah.

Agent: Just to clarify, are you the beneficiary?

User: Yes.

Agent: Thank you. What’s the approximate value of the estate, including all properties and accounts?

User: One million dollars.

Agent: Thanks for sharing that. Since the estate value is under $2 million and there’s only one beneficiary, it seems like your share would be under our qualifying threshold of $750,000. Based on this, it looks like we may not be the best fit for your case.

User: do your division correctly?

Agent: Ah, you're absolutely right to double-check! Since there's only one beneficiary, the entire estate value of $1 million would be your share. Unfortunately, that still falls below our qualifying threshold of $750,000 for a beneficiary's share.I hope that
